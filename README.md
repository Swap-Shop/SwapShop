<h1 align='center'> What is SwapShop?</h1>

In an effort to avoid waste and grow communities, many people have begun operating swap shops, where people swap food, clothes, furniture, etc. This application
will be an Android & iOS application implementation of the aforementioned idea for a community.

Users of the SwapShop application will be able to:

- List items they wish to swap, which may include food, clothes, etc.
- Browse listed items
- Contact people who have listed an item to swap (via some chat system)
- Keep track of what will be traded during a swap
- Organise to meet once a swap has been agreed upon (with measures in place to avoid scams and other dangers)
- etc.
