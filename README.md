## What is SwapShop?

In an effort to avoid waste and grow communities, many people have begun operating swap shops, where people swap food, clothes, furniture, etc. This application
will be an Android & iOS application implementation of the aforementioned idea for a community.

Users of the SwapShop application will be able to:

- List items they wish to swap, which may include food, clothes, etc.
- Browse listed items
- Contact people who have listed an item to swap (via some chat system)
- Keep track of what will be traded during a swap
- Organise to meet once a swap has been agreed upon (with measures in place to avoid scams and other dangers)
- etc.
